This is the about.html page for my personal website portfolio. It contains info
about myself and where I come from. It has many elements similar to the
index.html page, but also contains a simple side navigation bar to two different
locations on the page.

              <p class="aboutinfo"> Born on November 28th, 2001 in Kirkland, WA,
                  I have been living in the Greater Seattle Area all of my life.
                  Growing up in Seattle, the tech haven of the Northwest, I
                  developed an entrepreneurial spirit and love for technology at
                  a young age. From hearing my dad talk about different projects
                  he took on at his job at Microsoft to participating in CodeDay
                  hackathons, my experiences led me to kindle a keen interest in
                  the potential applications of computer science. The likes of
                  Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates inspired me to dream of starting my
                  own company. <br> <br> As a Muslim American from an Indian
                  family, I have also been deeply connected with the Seattle
                  Muslim community. My faith and religious community are a big
                  part of who I am today.</p>

              <img id="NFM" src="NeedforMadness.PNG" alt=
              "NeedforMadness Racing Game">
              <p class="aboutinfo"> When I was twelve years old, my friend and I
                 created 3D car models for a racing game called Need for Madness
                 using Java to plot points in a coordinate system. This was my
                 first ever programming experience, and it was fascinating to
                 see how writing simple commands to the computer could translate
                 into something as complex as creating 3-D cars. The “magical”
                 result of clicking a mouse or pressing a key in a game started
                 to make logical sense.
                 From this point on, computer programming became a passion.
                 It was not only a way of expressing my creativity, but the
                 ever-growing impact it has as a field on our society today was
                 so appealing to me. After taking a couple of Java classes and
                 being involved in a few coding projects, I knew that I wanted
                 to major in computer science. After earning an Associate Degree
                 in CS through dual-enrollment (Running Start), I was directly
                 admitted to the UW CSE major. I'm excited to continue my CS
                 education at UW and hope to participate in undergraduate
                 research and internships. I also want to minor in
                 Entrepreneurship to fulfill my dream of creating a successful
                 Startup company. </p>
