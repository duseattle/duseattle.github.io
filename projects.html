This is the projects.html page for my personal website portfolio. It contains
images and brief descriptions of software and hardware projects I have done in
the past. It does not contain a whole lot, but hopefully that will change very
soon! This page also does not contain a background image.

            <h6> PROJECTS AND EXTRACURRICULARS </h6>
            <h5> Deep Learning - MNIST dataset </h5>
            <img src="MNIST.PNG" alt="Deep Learning">
            <p class="proj"> In fall of 2017, I took on a deep learning project
              that was recommended to me by my professor. A classmate and I were
              able to develop a Java program that could recognize handwritten
              digits by training and testing through neural networks.
              Through this project, we were able to learn a lot about
              artificial intelligence, deep learning, and neural networks.
              These fascinating fields have endless applications, and it was a
              great experience to be able to work on a “gateway” project to
              these fields. Neural networks, being similar in function and
              purpose to our brain, have numerous current and potential
              applications, including, but not limited to, chemical engineering,
              nuclear power plants, wind speed energy modeling, and construction.
              Not only that, but there are current uses for neural networks too,
              such as processing the bank account number or other numerical
              information from handwritten checks or forms. The future is bright
              for neural networks, as they will become a major focus of research
              in computer science going forwards. We were able to get a head
              start on neural networks by finishing this project while still in
              undergraduate college. </p>

              <h5> Home Automation (Arduino and RaspberryPi)</h5>
              <img src="HomeAutomation.PNG" alt="Home Automation Interface">
              <p class="proj"> During winter and spring of 2018, I worked on a
                home automation project as part of my STEM cohort at Bellevue
                College with another class member. We used Arduino and
                RaspberryPi to create a system that connected to different
                features using Wifi communication. We were able to create a user
                interface that could control features such as lights, smoke
                sensors, temperature, etc.
